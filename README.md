# AugmentedLock

Developed an Augmented Reality Authentication Mechanism that allows users to authenticate themselves by interacting with a virtual keypad generated on a real-world surface of the user's choice.

Below is a simple testing interface that allowed me to test different input key patterns.

Below is a demo of the actual Authentication Mechanism. <br/>
First the user places a virtual keypad on a surface of their choice.

The user then points the selector shape at the button to be selected. Here position of the button is used to calculate the selection. The buttons are positioned in a [1 2 3], [4 5 6], [7 8 9] order.

Once the buttons are selected correctly and match the input key pattern, the next activity is opened.
